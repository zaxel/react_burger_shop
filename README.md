# Burger Shop
This is a short and lightweight application that simulates a **`burger shop`** order system, written in **`React`**.<br/> 
The app simulates three separate shops from which you can choose while making an order. All data is stored in Firebase DB, so every time you log back into your account, you have all your burgers and orders from the previous session.<br/>
Additionally, there are a few versions of the app, one of which allows you to **`log`** into your account using **`google`** or **`github`**.<br/> 

 
### Features:
* Three different shops from which you can choose where to buy.;
* Three sections in each shop:
    * Burger menu where you can order items.
    * Your current orders manager where you can see all your ordered items, including amount, price, discount, etc. You are free to add/remove items in your order.
    * Burger shop menu editor where you can create items by adding title, description, price, etc. You can also edit existing cards at any time.
* Some cool animations on item cards and in the Order section.
* All data in these sections is synchronized with Firebase, so making changes in one section affects the same data in the other two.
* Social media OAuth login.; 
* and many more;
